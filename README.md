# README

This is the Private Events project from the Odin Project's Ruby on Rails course: https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/private-events

The assignment is to make an application similar to Eventbrite.

A user can create events. A user can attend many events. An event can be attended by many users. Events take place at a specific date and at a location (which you can just store as a string, like “Andy’s House”).
